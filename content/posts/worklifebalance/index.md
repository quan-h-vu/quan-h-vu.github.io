I had to step away from work recently for reasons I hadn't expected. The main reason had nothing to do with my employer. Things were going well at work. I had felt reinvigorated at my last company for over a year prior to my departure.

Unfortunately, I was a mess outside of work. The COVID-19 pandemic had taken a severe toll on me. I left my domestic partner of many years by its end. A lot happened in the world while we were all trapped inside our homes. Much more continues to happen in the world today. If you pay too much attention to the news, it can look like the world is ending. And if you don't know how to cope, you can end up like the dog in this meme.

I needed to learn how to cope effectively. I didn't have work-life balance. Any stress at work was magnified in the absence of joy outside of work. For anyone else struggling with this, here are my tips for achieving work-life balance in the apocalypse.

## Seek Therapy

If you can afford it, give therapy a try. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people seeking therapy surged dramatically. Therapy can be a tremendous tool to help you manage stress.

Based on my own experience, I think everyone can benefit from some amount of therapy. As someone who tends to overthink situations, therapy has taught me how to stop overthinking. That keeps me from fixating on problems, whether they are work or personal issues. It also forces me to exercise my critical thinking skills on a regular basis. This helps me make quick, sound decisions at work and in my personal life.

Since the pandemic, therapy has become much more accessible with many therapists offering virtual sessions. If you have access, I recommend finding a therapist who's right for you.

## Volunteer

If you have time and energy, find an opportunity to volunteer in your local community. In a world that feels increasingly chaotic, volunteering lends you a sense of control and stability, letting you exercise agency towards a cause. 

I have been volunteering with a local food bank, [The Friendly Center](https://friendlycenter.org/), for over a year. From my own experience, one day of volunteering feels more impactful than any news article I've ever read and any opinion I've ever expressed on social media. I get to see the impact firsthand on people struggling to literally feed their families. It feels rewarding to help in a small but sure way.

There are many ways to find volunteering opportunities. I found The Friendly Center from a Google search. (My search took me to [Volunteer Network OC](https://www.volunteernetworkoc.org/), which led me to The Friendly Center.) Libraries often need volunteers for different programs such as after-school tutoring and adult ESL. In addition, many companies (including my last company) organize corporate volunteering events for their employees.

Volunteering lets you make a small but definite impact. If you can spare the time and energy, I highly recommend volunteering as a way of managing stress.

## Reduce news consumption

During the pandemic, I became overly fixated on the news. At the time, everyone had to pay close attention because new safety guidance came to light on a daily basis. Since we were trapped in our homes, many of us also followed the news more closely as a form of entertainment.

While it's healthy to be informed, it's not healthy to be fixated on the news. Much like I needed work-life balance, I also needed to balance my news consumption. I've found a healthy approach that works for me: my interest in any given topic should be proportional to the amount of control I have in the situation. 

During the pandemic, we needed the news for very practical reasons. Nowadays, there is much less practical benefit. Reduce your news consumption, specifically for [hard news](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hard-news). Stay informed enough to take action when needed. But establish appropriate boundaries.

### Reduce news consumption on social media

It's worth calling out that you should avoid news consumption on social media as much as possible. Rage bait abounds on social media platforms and for good reason. If you want people to take action on anything, one of the most efficient ways to do so is to get them mad. Social media is full of users actively trying to get us mad enough to take action.

I mostly stopped using social media years ago. One issue I had was that, as social media showed me, there was always a legitimate reason to be angry about a legitimate issue somewhere in the world. I spent a large chunk of time being angry about issues all around the world, exposed to me via social media. But with little control over many of these issues, my social media consumption amounted to little more than doomscrolling. It was not healthy or sustainable.

Social media is an incubator for anger. Avoid engaging with news on social media. Establish appropriate boundaries with social media to help manage its effect on you.
