## About This Sample

The sample below is a companion to [one of my first pieces of API documentation](/samples/webhooks), which provides an overview of available webhooks. This sample is a reference page for a specific webhook providing vehicle diagnostic trouble code (DTC) data.

| Data | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Tools    | Markdown, Git                       |
| SMEs     | multiple engineers, product manager |
| Others   | none                                  |

The source document is available [here](https://lytxdeveloperportal.redoc.ly/docs/webhook_dtc/). It has been reproduced below to preserve my contributions. The sample begins below the line.

The DTC webhook integration allows clients to bring DTC data from LytxÂ® devices into a 3rd-party system. Clients can leverage this data to power robust maintenance solutions to help keep their vehicles in top condition.
