I led an initiative to build an internal wiki for product documentation using Confluence. This story highlights my leadership and expertise in content strategy.

## Problem Addressed

Operations teams 

As a member of the Product Management team, I often supported PMs by fielding internal questions about our products. When the pandemic forced us all into a remote work environment, those questions grew in number. Further, I discovered that different operations teams had created their own knowledge silos with information that was often either outdated or conflicting. This caused much confusion.

## Analysis and Challenges

When I built the wiki initially, I wrote most of the documentation myself because I was the sole technical writer. But I found adoption of the wiki to be a challenge. One thing I failed to realize earlier is that the key to the wikiâ€™s success was collaboration. Without that, very few people knew about the wiki; fewer still had incentive to change habits by using this wiki rather than their existing source of information. I had just created another knowledge silo.

The wiki started gaining traction when I started collaborating with other teams more formally. I started meeting with various operations teams on a monthly basis to discuss their documentation needs. I also modified documentation based on their feedback. This consistent communication and collaboration fostered trust in the internal wiki, promoting wider adoption. The Client Success team retired their own wiki altogether in favor of the Product-led wiki. Other teams audited their materials using the Product wiki.

## Solution Implemented


## Why It Matters

The goal was to establish a reliable source of truth for the first time, directly from the Product Management team, that served the needs of operations teams downstream. Then those teams could use this information to update their own materials accordingly. This would help operations directly by reducing their confusion. This would also help product managers by reducing their time spent fielding questions.

## About This Sample


This template doesn't work for this story. The challenge in the middle is like a 2nd problem addressed/solution implemented.

The solution isn't just the wiki itself. The solution is also the collaboration meetings on the wiki.
