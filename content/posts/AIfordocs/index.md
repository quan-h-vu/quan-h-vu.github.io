## Using AI for Documentation

With the advent of AI, I've also been researching the use of AI for documentation. I had difficulty researching AI initially because there was too much noise. On one hand, there is much hype around AI. It's ground-breaking technology that could completely transform our entire world. On the other hand, there's lots of doomsaying. If transformation is too rapid--meaning, it outpaces our ability to adapt to the transformation--this could leave many people unemployed. Automation is nothing new but AI presents a different level of automation than we're prepared for.

Thankfully, Tom Johnson also has some resources on using AI for documentation. These are divided into two main sections: one section covers use cases for AI; the other section goes in-depth on AI prompt engineering. These have been helpful in figuring out how to leverage AI on a practical level. These are some of my key takeaways:

- AI can be used to produce a first draft. You can feed unstructured information culled from several sources to the AI. You can also give it templates to follow. Then the AI can synthesize that information into a cohesive draft. The draft still needs to be vetted for accuracy as AI is still prone to "hallucinations." But you can get off to a quicker start. In such scenarios, the job of the tech writer is to research information to feed to the AI and edit the draft for accuracy and style.
