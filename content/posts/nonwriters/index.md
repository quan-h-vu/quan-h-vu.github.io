I have spent much of my technical writing career as a "team-of-one" writer. One lesson I've learned is that, even when I'm the only technical writer at a company, I'm not the only one making documentation. People all around the company are developing content to serve various needs. Consider the following examples.

- Product managers write Jira stories to communicate acceptance criteria to engineers.
- Engineers document their development decisions to promote consistency.
- Technical support leads write troubleshooting articles and scripts for specific scenarios.
- Account managers answer client questions via email.

Writing abounds at all levels of any organization. Sometimes, content is created by professional writers. But often, it's created by non-writers who just happen to write for their profession at times. For these non-writers, here are my writing tips to help you communicate more effectively (short of cheating with AI, of course).

## Write for Scanning

People like to say that no one reads but that's not strictly true. No one reads *thoroughly*, at least not initially. They scan. Their eyes skim text, looking for evidence of the information they desire. If they detect something, then they slow down and read a certain portion more thoroughly.

As a writer, one of your goals is to facilitate the visual scanning of text. You can accomplish this in a few ways.

- Headings: Organize your content into logical sections with descriptive headings (the title also counts as a type of heading). Users typically look to headings first to guide their search for information. Craft accurate, succinct headings to help users decide quickly if a section of the document is relevant to them. 
- Lists and tables: Use lists and tables frequently. Lists and tables are highly organized forms of information, making them easy to scan. If information fits into a list or table, use a list/table.
- Graphics and screenshots: Include graphics and screenshots that aid comprehension. Some examples include screenshots/mockups of software, line drawings of hardware, and workflow diagrams.
- Table of contents: For longer documents, a table of contents can give users an overview of the document and let them quickly jump to various sections.

Need concrete examples? The list above might be good enough explaining how. At least compared to the lack of tips for the other sections.

## Organize by Importance

Another way to facilitate scanning is to organize information by importance, leading with the most important information. In journalism, this is known as the inverted pyramid method.

[With the inverted pyramid method](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/), you assume that readers are busy, busy enough that they can and will be interrupted midway through reading your article. Maybe a more urgent issue takes their attention away. Maybe they just arrive at their bus stop.

As a writer, one of your goals is to organize information such that, when readers inevitably get interrupted, they still learn the most important details. This applies on a macro level, meaning the sections of a document should be organized by importance. This also applies on a micro level, meaning within each section or paragraph, details should be organized by importance.

Guidelines for "importance"?

Consider the following excerpt from one of my samples:

> The AM2 model of hazard identification is designed to reward reactive drivers. The model integrates audio alerts and incident logs into a cohesive system of escalation. Audio alerts allow drivers to correct their own driving behavior; an incident log is only generated as the next level of escalation if they fail to react. Even further, prevention logs are generated for reactive drivers, giving managers an opportunity to recognize them.

The first sentence of this can easily be moved to the end of the paragraph. It would make sense because, in the workflow described in the text, the reward for reactive drivers also occurs at the end. This revision is

## Remove Clutter

The details you decide to exclude from your document are almost as important as the details you decide to include. This is similar to the idea of clutter in UX design.

In UX, designers are often tasked with [reducing visual clutter from designs](https://www.lionandmason.com/ux-blog/reducing-cognitive-overload-declutter-your-design-for-better-ux/). The idea is that clutter distracts users, slowing them down from achieving their user goals.

In writing, details that are unimportant can be seen as clutter. By removing unimportant details, users can more easily focus on the important details.
