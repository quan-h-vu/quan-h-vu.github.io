title: "Today I Learned: Using AI for Documentation"
type: "post"
draft: true
---

With the advent of AI, I've been researching the use of AI for documentation. I had difficulty researching AI initially because there was too much noise. On one hand, there is much hype around AI. It's ground-breaking technology that could completely transform our entire world. On the other hand, there's lots of doomsaying. If transformation is too rapid--meaning, it outpaces our ability to adapt to the transformation--this could leave many people unemployed. Automation is nothing new but AI presents a different level of automation than we're prepared for.

This intro isn't working.

Thankfully, Tom Johnson also has some resources on using AI for documentation. These are divided into two main sections: one section covers use cases for AI; the other section goes in-depth on AI prompt engineering. These have been helpful in figuring out how to leverage AI on a practical level. These are some of my key takeaways:

AI can be used to produce a first draft. You can feed unstructured information culled from several sources to the AI. You can also give it templates to follow. Then the AI can synthesize that information into a cohesive draft. The draft still needs to be vetted for accuracy as AI is still prone to "hallucinations." But you can get off to a quicker start. In such scenarios, the job of the tech writer is to research information to feed to the AI and to edit the draft for accuracy and style.

What have I learned about AI?
- AI is prone to "delusions". AI is not rational itself. It is mimicking patterns of people who are rational. Something like that. There is a need to vet AI-generated text for accuracy.
- AI is better when the topic is already well-known, well-established. So it can write essays on Shakespeare well because there's already so much content out there. It will be less accurate with newer topics with less data.
- AI is better at simple tasks, not as good at complex tasks.
- There are many scenarios in which AI would be helpful.
  - Summarization of text. You can generate an intro summary for your doc if the rest of the doc is done. You can get the gist of long pieces of text from AI. As such, AI is good at release notes and glossaries.
  - You can use AI to analyze large amounts of data that would be hard for a human to analyze themselves. For example, AI can identify patterns in tech support cases to help guide your content.
  - You can use AI to separate large amounts of data into different classifications. This can be done by humans but it's a tedious process.
