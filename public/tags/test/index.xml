      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to step away from work recently for reasons I hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected. The main reason had nothing to do with my employer. Things were going well at work. I had felt reinvigorated at my last company for over a year prior to my departure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have work-life balance because I was a mess outside of work. I had recently left my partner of seven years. More than that, the COVID-19 pandemic had taken a severe mental toll on me. A lot happened in the world while we were all trapped inside our homes. Much more continues to happen in the world today. If you pay enough attention to the news, it can look like the world is ending, minus the zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
