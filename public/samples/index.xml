      <description>&lt;p&gt;I led an initiative to improve our internal release notes template. This story highlights my leadership and expertise in content strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-addressed&#34;&gt;Problem Addressed&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Product managers were responsible for providing internal release notes to operations teams to allow them to prepare for upcoming releases. However, some teams expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of detail. Some even admitted they stopped reading the release notes because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PMs themselves were also frustrated because they used the release notes to communicate important information. But they still received questions on details addressed in the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-this-sample&#34;&gt;About This Sample&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sample below was written about a fictional dashcam product, showing users how to retrieve DVR video via an online portal. The product is based on a real product I have documented, though many details have been changed in this document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Links in the sample are blank cross-references. The sample begins below the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrieving-dvr-video&#34;&gt;Retrieving DVR Video&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Video Retrieval portal lets you search for footage from your cameras’ DVR storage and save it to the cloud for future use. When your camera’s DVR storage reaches its limit, the oldest video gets overwritten by new video. You must retrieve any desired footage before this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
