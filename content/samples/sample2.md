## Retrieving DVR Video

The Video Retrieval portal lets you search for footage from your cameras’ DVR storage and save it to the cloud for future use. When your camera’s DVR storage reaches its limit, the oldest video gets overwritten by new video. You must retrieve any desired footage before this occurs.

1. Go to the Vehicle Connect page. Search for the desired vehicle using the available search filters.
2. Press Connect for the desired vehicle. This opens the Video Retrieval page to access the vehicle’s available DVR footage.
	- If the connection attempt fails, the vehicle is most likely in an area with poor reception. If a wifi network is available near the vehicle, the vehicle’s device can be configured to connect over wifi. For more detail, refer to [Configuring Wifi Networks on the Device](https://quanhvu.com).
3. On the Video Retrieval page, search for desired video footage using the available playback tools.
	- Zoom: Each camera can hold up to 200 hours of footage. Use the timeline’s zoom options to focus on specific 24-hr, 4-hr, or 1-hr sections for playback.
	- Speed: Video playback speed can be adjusted for easier review from 0.25x up to 8x speed.
	- Map: The map shows segments representing available video based on the vehicle’s location. Select a segment from the map to queue up footage from there. If multiple segments are available at a location, right-click on the location and select from the list.
	- Tags: Tags are recorded for certain events including ignition on/off, door open/closed, and ramp/lift usage. These are displayed over the timeline. Use these as context clues to find the desired footage.
4. After you’ve identified the desired footage, press Clip. Drag the markers to the start and end of the footage to be saved (maximum: 300 seconds per clip). If desired, you can edit the Clip Name from the default.
5. Press Save.

After the clip is saved, it’s stored in the Video Library. It can be viewed and downloaded for 90 days after retrieval. For more detail, go to [Managing the Video Library](https://quanhvu.com).
